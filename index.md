### what do i do?  

Back in May of 2020 I graduated from the [Georgia Instistute of Technology](www.gatech.edu) with a BS in Aerospace Engineering. Since then I've been working for [MacStadium](www.macstadium.com) as a Sales Engineer. When I'm not at work I can be found going to EDM concerts, rock climbing, sailing, or trying to figure out when I'm next going skiing. 

I am open to a new position in the DevOps/SRE space. You can find my resume [here](resume.pdf)!

### what am i doing now? 

Projects I'm currently working on: 
* Send a v8 boulder and climb 5.13 (in the gym)
* Train to run a marathon 
* Training my dog for better recall

Projects on the horizon: 
* Go climbing at Red River Gorge 
* Crew for the Everglades Challenge
