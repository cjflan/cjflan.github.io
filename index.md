### what do i do?  

Back in May of 2020 I graduated from the [Georgia Instistute of Technology](www.gatech.edu) with a BS in Aerospace Engineering. Since then I've been working for [MacStadium](www.macstadium.com) as a technical account manager. When I'm not at work I can be found going to EDM concerts, rock climbing, or trying to figure out when I'm next going skiing. 

### what am i doing now? 

Some of the projects I'm currently working on are: 

* Completing this website
* Setting up a kubernetes cluster of Raspberry Pi's to self host microservices
* Learn to lead climb and finally send a v5
* Train to run the Denver marathon
