Developer. Aerospace Engineer. Tech Enthusiast. Outdoorsman.

### what do i do?  

Back in May of 2020 I graduated from the [Georgia Instistute of Technology](www.gatech.edu) with a BS in Aerospace Engineering. Since then I've been working for [MacStadium](www.macstadium.com) as a Sales Engineer. When I'm not at work I can be found going to EDM concerts, rock climbing, sailing, or trying to figure out when I'm next going skiing. 

### what am i doing now? 

Projects I'm currently working on: 
* Learn to lead climb and finally send a v7 boulder
* Train to run the Denver marathon 
* Do some ice climbing 

Projects on the horizon: 
* Set up a kubernetes cluster of Raspberry Pi's to self host microservices
* Set up said microservices
* Do some big wall climbing
* Crew for the Everglades Challenge

To see finished projects check out my [blog](blog)!
